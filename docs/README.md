*Note: In this documentation, uppercase (and usually linked) names refer to classes, while lowercase names refer to non-class things.  For example: [Particle](Particle/README.md) refers to the class itself or an instance of the class which manages a large number of particles (lowercase).  particle(s) usually refers to a collection of attributes (ex: v_para, v_perp or mu, and s, as well as maybe time, index, etc) that represents a `real-world physical particle`.*
